# Learning Platform (Server)

An online learning platform that teachers could use to post lessons, 
quizzes and assignments. 
They can also message their students directly to interact with them one on one. 
There will also be a space where students can post. 
Other students can also search through and upvote these posts. 

# Instructions
Clone the git repo into a folder.   
Open the terminal and type:  

npm start

# Login
You can login with this username and password:

username: Hash123
password: 123

There is a register page but no register feature.


# Features
Phase 1:    (Core Functionality)   
Users can login. 
Users can create, edit and delete posts.   

Phase 2: (Future Plans)  
Users can create group chats. Users can sort through and look up posts. Users can submit assignments. Users can directly message other users. Users can also register for new account.

Phase 3:    (Future Plans)  
Teachers can create tests that students can take. They will receive feedback once the test is complete. 




# Lessons learned & next steps   
I would like to make the UI more appealing by adding more icons or images.   
Also, add more features like a to-do list page and reply to posts.

I also want to add a feature of instant messaging with Socket.io.
